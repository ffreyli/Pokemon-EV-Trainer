# Pokemon-EV-Trainer

## Description:
This is an idea that I have had for a while and decided to finally create it using the skills I learned from the Coding Dojo bootcamp.
It is an application designed to help a user keep tally and keep track of any number of entities' Effort Value statistic, a number that is normally kept track of
manually by users.
Effort Values are a hidden statistic that is tracked in the Pokemon games, and whenever a Pokemon gains experience, it earns Effort Values.

For more information on Effort Values and why they matter, it is explained much better here: https://www.serebii.net/games/evs.shtml

## Technologies Used:
MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack
Pokemon API
PokeAPI on GitHub for sprites. https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites

## How to Install and Run the Project:
1. Download the repository
2. In the repository's folder install npm
3. run npm start

## How to Use the Project:
This project allows users to create Pokemon to keep track of their EVs while playing a Pokemon game. In the application the user can select the matching 
Pokemon sprite, give it a nickname, and create the Pokemon. Multiple Pokemon's stats can be created and tracked in this way. When clicking on a Pokemon,
we can view its counters for each stat, that users can increment or decrement. The application saves updates to Effort Values for each stat.
