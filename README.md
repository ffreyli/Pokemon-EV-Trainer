# Pokemon-EV-Trainer

## Description:
This is an idea that I have had for a while and decided to finally create it using the skills I learned from the Coding Dojo bootcamp.
It is an application designed to help a user keep track of a Pokemon's EVs, or Effort Values, when playing a Pokemon game. 
Effort Values are a hidden statistic that is tracked in the Pokemon games, and whenever a Pokemon gains experience, it earns Effort Values.

For more information on Effort Values and why they matter, it is explained much better here: https://www.serebii.net/games/evs.shtml
